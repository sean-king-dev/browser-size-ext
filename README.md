# Viewable Area


## Installation
- Open chrome://extensions/  in url bar.

- Now click on the Load unpacked button. It will open a popup screen asking you to upload your extensions folder containing all the files we have discussed. Upload them.

- On the tab bar select your newly added extension (you should see a 'V' logo), and click on the extension any time you want to check the viewable area of a tab you're looking at. It will display the X axis width and Y axis height.
